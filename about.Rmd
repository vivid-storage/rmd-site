This sample site demonstrates how to use RMarkdown to create a website. The site includes examples of code chunks, plots, and tables.

## Table Example

Here is an example of a table:

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Create a simple data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(30, 25, 35)
)

# Print the data frame
df
